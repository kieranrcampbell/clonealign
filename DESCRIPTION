Title: Assigning scRNA-seq to clone-of-origin using copy number from ultra-low-depth scDNA-seq
Version: 1.99.3
Authors@R: person("Kieran", "Campbell", email = "kieranrcampbell@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: clonealign assigns single-cell RNA-seq to clones of origin based on copy number data. This is useful when single-cell RNA-seq and DNA-seq are measured (separately) on the same set of cells, clones are inferred based on copy number profiles of the scDNA-seq, and the expression profile of each clone is desired.
